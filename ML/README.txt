To prepare your environment / follow along with the session, you will first need to do the following:

1) Install SQL Server (Express or Development Edition) available at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads and set up an instance (no particular settings required).

2) Install R (64-bit) available at any CRAN mirror, see: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ 

3) On SQL Server, run the supplied ml_lecture_sql_data_setup.sql script.  This will create your database, objects and data.

4) On R, ensure you have installed the required packages (see demo 1) using install.packages().
